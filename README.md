# Gallery of Horns

## **According to the project's Overview,**

> By the end of this module, you will create an application that displays images and information of horned animals. This application will allow you to filter the images by number of horns and chose your favorite image. For this class we will just be focusing on the component structure of the application. You will create a new React application using Vite and fill it with components. Refer to ‘Feature Tasks’ to see exactly which components to build and where to display them.

### Feature #1: Display Images

Why are we implementing this feature?

- As a user, I want to view the images on the page so that I can browse the photo collection.

What are we going to implement?

> Given that a user opens the application in the browser
> When the user navigates to the home page
> Then the photo gallery should display all of the beasts' images in the gallery.

How are we implementing it?
> The `Gallery` component should pass props for the title, image and description to each `HornedBeast` component. You will find this information in the provided JSON file.
